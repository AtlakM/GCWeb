<div lang="en">
<p>Custom CSS/JavaScript for GC promotional thematic use.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Be sponsored by a GC department and by an active representative from that department</li>
	<li>Must provide an expiration date</li>
	<li>Must be used on a considerable set of pages. It must worth it. Exact size would be provided in the future.</p>
	<li>Each feature must be demoed</li>
	<li>An accessibility conformance report (ACR) must be provided per feature or per demoed pages.</li>
	<li>Must list all CSS class and exposed JS function</li>
	<li>Quickly describe the purpose of each feature</li>
	<li>Must not be a departmental common style</li>
	<li>Their usage must be in conformance with the Canada.ca content and information architecture specification</li>
	<li>Must be only used for campaign or promotional event, like Canada Day</li>
	<li>Must no contain any interference with wet-boew, GCWeb.</li>
	<li>Loading the feature must not change the state of generic page. Feature must be explicitly activated through HTML by the web publisher, like the wet-boew plugin or the usage of a CSS class onto an HTML element.</li>
	<li>Must be designed by following the progressive enhancement design approach</li>
	<li>Must be coded by respecting the code linting practice of GCWeb.</li>
	<li>Favour a naming convention for feature that represents the campaign followed by their function. This is to avoid collision with other styles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that all active feature from any GC promotional thematic project are going to be merged into one unique CSS file and one unique JS file, like any méli-mélo compilation. This framework are excluded from the GCWeb API. Any change or removal would only trigger a patch release of GCWeb. That means the author are fully responsible but not required to documents any subsequent change they would make at their project.</p>

<p>An accessibility statement could be accepted in replacement of the accessibility conformance report but only for tiny feature.</p>


<h3>Expiration date</h3>
<p>It need to be less than one (1) years from the submission indicating when the promotional thematic feature can be removed. As needed, extension can be granted upon agreement of interest parties. During the renewal process we might ask for additional evidence, might require the removal of some sub-feature or initiate their conversion into a méli-mélo project.</p>

<h2>Temporary implementation measure</h2>
<p>We are currently in progress to adapt our build script to support those GC promotional thematic feature on it's own. As an interim measure, we are going to use the méli-mélo compilation named "gc-thematic" to let department to start using this framework for their GC promotional campaign.</p>
