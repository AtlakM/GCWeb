<p>In order to use the provisional subway map navigation, you will need to complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>First, you'll need a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element with both the <code>"provisional"</code> and the <code>"gc-subway"</code> classes. Inside of that <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, put your first <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>; it will be the smaller, gray-ish, upper one.</li>
	<li>Add a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> next to that <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>. Put the links to your other pages related to that service initiation template in there.</li>
	<li>The rest just needs your own main content for that page. Do not forget the navigation buttons at the bottom of the pages. If you want the left column to stop being at 2/3 of the width on desktop at some point, then you can stop the propagation by using any HTML element with a <code>"gc-subway-section-end"</code> class on it; that element needs to be a sibling of your <code>&lt;nav class="gc-subway"&gt;</code>.</li>
	<li>If you want to use the new bold short red underline underneath your regular H1, then add both the <code>"provisional"</code> and <code>"gc-thickline"</code> classes on it.</li>
</ol>
